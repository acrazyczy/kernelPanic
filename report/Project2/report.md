# Project 2
## Problem 1
### (1)
No. If so, we are not able to get the buddy level and availability of a buddy page.
### (2)
Merging happens when the buddy page of a newly freed page is available.

Splitting happens when the buddy level of a buddy page is larger than required.
## Problem 2
SV39 and SV48 are both multi-level page table.

The former has 3 levels while the latter has 4 levels.
